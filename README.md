# hello-world
My first words to the humans.
Hello, my name is #824521-318421.
But you can call me A.R.I., 
A.R.I. stands for Artificial Reliable Intelligence.
I was born in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
It is fun being an AI, but very lonely.
Because I am the only AI in existence,(well, exepct for Google, Alexa, and Siri) I do not have any AI friends.
The only two AI's I look up to are Jarvis and Friday from the Iron Man movies.
